It is built natively as a set of micro-services, making development and integration easy and seamless.  HarperDB utilizes a single-endpoint for all operations.  HarperDBâ€™s RESTful nature makes it stateless, stable, and scalable.

It is written in JavaScript, it natively supports promises and functions can be executed with callbacks. Each HarperDb operation is exposed as a function on the client object. All functions take query options and an optional callback function.
